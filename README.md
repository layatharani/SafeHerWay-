**Title:**
SafeHerWay: Crime Rate and Hotspot Prediction System for Women

**Abstract:**
	Crime against women has become a critical issue worldwide and there is a need for accurate and effective prediction models to improve women's safety. In India, according to the National Commission for Women (NCW) report, nearly 31,000 complaints of crimes against women were received in 2022. Crime against women is increasing at an alarming rate in almost all parts of India. 
	To improve women's safety, an accurate and effective crime prediction model is needed to address a crime hotspot that experiences a higher rate of criminal activity compared to other areas. In these hotspots, women are the victims of various criminal activities like rape, sexual harassment, molestation, chain snatching, robbery, kidnapping, etc. Therefore, the identification of crime hotspots is an essential aspect of crime prevention and control. 
	The machine learning algorithms like K-means clustering and the Decision Tree algorithm were used in this project to develop a prediction model for crime against women in Vellore district. The SafeHerWay application can play a crucial role in improving women's safety by creating safer environments for women to live, work and thrive in. This application uses Google Maps API to show crime rates, identify danger zones and provide the safest routes through a customized map. 

**Aim:**
Project to develop reliable and accurate system for predicting crime hot spots in specific areas, focusing on crimes against women, using a popular Machine Learning algorithm.

**Libraries Required:**
Keras,
numpy,
pandas,
seaborn,
scikit learn,
Flask,
mysql.connector

**Procedure:**
1. Collect relevant crime data for specific area.
2. Clean and format data, identify missing or incorrect data.
3. Develop a model to predict crime hotspots.
4. Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy.
5. Design user-friendly interface for map display and safer routes.

**Working:**
Clone and download the repository and run the main.py file and view the output in the local server page.
